DO NOT be scared of making pickles.  This is easy, and I will give it to you in layman's terms.  
In a good authentic Kosher pickle there is no vinegar.  None, not a drop.  What kind of pickle has no vinegar?  A good one.  Think of it this way, a pickle with vinegar is a pickle that could have been really good, but the maker decided to cheat, and quicken the process.

241799,Praline Cake Filling,"I was looking for a praline cake filling and found this on the internet.  I found the original recipe to be too thick.  While it didn't harden like a praline, it was just simply too thick.  I've adjusted the quantities of milk and powdered sugar in order to have a filling that is spreadable.  After it cools, you may need to thin it with a little more evaporated milk.  If it's too thick start adding one tablespoon at a time until you get a consistency that can easily be spread on a cake without tearing the cake.  You are looking for a consistency that will slowly drip off of your mixing spoon.  There are other recipes for praline fillings that aren't cooked.  However, I find that the cooking of the mixture adds extra flavor and a richness that will not achieve by just mixing the ingredients together.

471446,Portobello Mushroom and Goat Cheese Sandwiches,"Served this recipe from Williams-Sonoma last night for dinner.  It was so good!!  I made the mistake of using leftover hamburger buns instead of following the directions of using sourdough rolls, which would have stood up better to the sauce, resulting in a soggy burger.

383000,Coconut Pecan Torte,"From General Foods Corporation, publication year 1963.  An elegant dessert; layers of ladyfingers and extra rich pudding buttercream. This is not the usual torte, it is more like a charlotte.  The rich filling is a cooked pudding buttercream reminiscent of the classic French buttercream that uses whipped eggs cooked with a hot sugar syrup; & once cooled butter is whipped in. This recipe is almost no cook. The only cooking is the cooking of the pudding. Everything else is assembly and chilling time.  You can use any brand ingredients (even store brands).  This is a brand name publication so it calls for it's own brands.  The buttercream is so good you could even use it to frost a cake.  Double or triple the buttercream for a cake if you wish. You could use different flavors of pudding, leave out the coconut and pecans and make any number of buttercream flavors (chocolate, butterscotch, etc.)  to frost any cake.

Yeast with 1/2 cup Luke warm water. Set aside.', '2)In a Large Bowl, mix well 4 C Flour and 1 T. salt. (to prevent the yeast coming in direct contact with the salt.).', ""3) Pour Yeast mix into the Flour mix, Using a wooden spoon, stir, add an additional 1 to 1 1/2 C Luke warm water until a dough forms and pulls away from the sides of the bowl. (doesn't take long for this to happen and the dough forms a clumpy mass.)."", ""4)Lightly flour your work surface, and dump out to knead. Knead for about 1-2 minutes, or until you get a recognizable ball. (this is not your main Kneading point, so don't fuss over it!) Let the dough now rest while you clean up your bowl you will now use to let the dough ferment inches (about 5-6 minutes rest time)."", '5) Once your bowl is clean and dry (wiped clean) You now will need to start the Kneading process. Here, there are two methods you can take Fast, or Slow. What is the difference between the two? Texture/Crumb.', 'Method 1: Fast- Knead your usual way by doing quarter turns for 3-8 minutes, forming a nice elastic and smooth ball. Place Ball in your Large bowl and cover with Plastic. Let Rise for 90-120 minutes.', 'Method 2: Slow/Slap Bench: Begin to knead your dough, but this technique will be somewhat different than your typical quarter turn kneading. With this, the dough is flattened out slightly, then roughly fold dough into a single book fold ((Fold onto the second third and last third onto the second third)), held at one end (dough shape will be oblong) and slapped down on the work surface. Refolded and repeated about 850 times. YES 850! lol Once this is accomplished, dough is rounded into a ball and placed within the bowl to rise. 90-120 minutes, covered with plastic. (while this sounds outlandish, this is the traditional method and the texture is UN-BE-Leavable.) I also find that this method is less tiresome than normal kneading.', '6) Now that the dough has fermented, we can begin to form our loaves. Turn Dough out onto your kneading surface and flatten with your hands (by a smacking action) expelling all the gasses out of the dough. Divide into two equal parts. Round each piece into a ball, Rest for 5 minutes.', ""7)Prepare a Couche (A couche can be made by using a piece of linen or Towel, non-terry-cloth usually a little bigger than a tea-towel, which has had flour generously smoothed into the fabric to fill any creases and crevices of the towel used.) Set up your towel up to cradle your loaves. (This step isn't needed, but it helps to support the dough as it rises and gives a less flat result.)."", '8)Taking one portion, flatten out with your hands expelling all gasses. Take the top and fold down 2/3rds onto the dough, using the heal of your hand, seal the dough onto itself. Repeat fold and seal again. Fold down once more, but fold down to the bottom this time, sealing the top to the bottom.', '9)Lastly, taper off the ends of the dough by rolling your hands at the ends lighly with a bit of pressure to form a classic French Bread look. (at this point you can continue to roll your hands down the length of the dough to make a baguette rather than taper the ends).', '10) Place your dough seal side down onto your couche, leaving a bit of space for the loaves to expand between the two, yet still giving it support.', '11) Gash 3 cuts into the top of the loaves. Cover with the rest of the towel and Let rise an hour.', ""12) Gently peal the couche back from the loaves and GENTLY place them on either a baking sheet or a (lightly floured) paddle for placing onto baking stone. (Many would be tempted to use corn meal to prevent sticking, but that then takes it out of the 4 Ingredient Rule, making it untraditional French Bread.) You do not want to be rough, as you don't want them to deflate."", '13) Brush the tops of the risen dough with cool water using a pastry brush.', '14) Cooking: Toss 1/2 Cup water into the bottom of the Hot Preheated Oven 425 (Beware! Steam is HOT! BE CAREFUL) Place loaves in the oven and close. Turn the oven down to 350 and bake for 28-30 minutes.', '15) Bread is done when the bottoms sound hollow when tapped and the loaves are a rich almost dark golden colour.', ""16) For more information on the extensive technique used: Google French Bread Julia Child and view video's available.

390060,Reblochon Tarts With Bacon &amp; Fingerling Potatoes,"F&W Magazine, October 2008 edition. Terrence Brenan s the author of this recipe as it originally appeared in this edition. From Pairing of the Day: October 2008, Strategies for Cooking with Cheese. With a golden layer of puff pastry topped by caramelized onions, soft potatoes, bacon and tangy Reblochon cheese, this tart is lighter than the sum of its parts, making for a satisfying fall dish that’s great any time of day. The Reblochon, a washed-rind cheese from France, can be replaced with a robust Taleggio from northern Italy or the smooth French soft-ripened cow’s-milk cheese Saint-Andre. Wine suggestions: the earthy, berry-rich flavors of Pinot Noirs from California’s Santa Lucia Highlands work well as partners for washed-rind cheeses like the Reblochon in this tart. Jason Miller likes to pour the silky 2005 Logan Pinot Noir. The floral 2006 Morgan Twelve Clones is an equally good option Now that I have finished with the preliminaries I have to say these were delicious - with cheese being melted over the caramelized onions was a real treat - to say the least. ;)","['fingerling potatoes', 'bacon', 'extra virgin olive oil', 'onion', 'salt', 'fresh ground black pepper', 'crushed red pepper flakes', 'all-purpose flour', 'puff pastry', 'reblochon cheese']","[""2   medium    fingerling potatoes"",""4   slices    bacon"",""1 1/2  tablespoons    extra virgin olive oil"",""1   medium    onion, thinly sliced "",""  salt"",""  fresh ground black pepper"",""  crushed red pepper flakes"",""  all-purpose flour, for rolling "",""1/2  lb   cold all-butter puff pastry (we used 1/2 a box of Pepperidge Farm)"",""1/4  lb    reblochon cheese, rind removed and cheese thinly sliced ""]",1 (128 g),4,"['In a small saucepan, cover the potatoes with cold water and bring to a boil.', 'Cook over high heat until tender when pierced with a knife, about 15 minutes.', 'Drain, then peel and thinly slice crosswise.', 'Meanwhile, in a medium skillet, cook the bacon over moderately high heat until crisp, about 5 minutes; transfer to paper towels.', 'Cut the slices in thirds.', 'Preheat the oven to 375°F', 'Pour off the bacon fat in the skillet and add the oil.', 'Add the onion and cook over moderate heat, stirring frequently, until softened and browned, about 15 minutes; add water as necessary, 1 tablespoon at a time, to prevent scorching.', 'Transfer the onion to a bowl; season with salt, pepper, &amp; crushed red pepper flakes.', 'Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.', 'On a lightly floured work surface, roll out the puff pastry to an 11-inch square.', 'Using a plate as your guide, cut out four 5-inch rounds.', 'Transfer the rounds to the prepared baking sheet and prick them all over with a fork.', 'Bake the rounds in the center of the oven for about 8 minutes, until puffed and lightly golden.', 'Using the back of a fork, deflate the rounds and bake for about 4 minutes longer, until the pastry is just set.', 'Top the pastry rounds with the onion, potato slices, bacon and cheese.', 'Bake for about 10 minutes, until the cheese is melted and the pastry is browned.', 'Transfer the tarts to plates; serve hot or warm.']","['bacon', 'time-to-make', 'course', 'main-ingredient', 'cuisine', 'preparation', 'occasion', 'north-american', 'savory-pies', 'main-dish', 'eggs-dairy', 'pork', 'vegetables', 'american', 'french', 'european', 'dinner-party', 'finger-food', 'holiday-event', 'cheese', 'thanksgiving', 'northeastern-united-states', 'meat', 'onions', 'taste-mood', 'savory', 'presentation', 'served-hot', '4-hours-or-less']","{'french', 'dinner'}"

See my tips at the bottom of the recipe directions.","['steak', 'peanut oil', 'unsalted butter', 'fresh thyme', 'kosher salt', 'black pepper', 'garlic powder', 'soup', 'whole mushrooms', 'burgundy wine']","[""16   ounces    steak (at least one inch thick)"",""2   tablespoons    peanut oil"",""3   tablespoons    unsalted butter"",""  fresh thyme (several sprigs)"",""  kosher salt (to taste)"",""  black pepper (to taste)"",""  garlic powder (to taste)"",""1 (10 1/2  ounce) can  campbell\u0027s french onion condensed soup"",""2 (8   ounce) cans  small whole mushrooms, like button mushrooms  (plus the juice of one can or jar)"",""1/3  cup    Burgundy wine""]",1 (532 g),2,"['Take the steak(s) out of the refrigerator 45 minutes before cooking time. Pat the steak dry on both sides with paper towels. Drying them is very important to getting that good crust that you want on the outside.', ""Sprinkle both sides of the steak liberally with salt, pepper, garlic powder and any other seasonings you might like on your steak. Let the steak rest at room temp for 45 minutes on a cutting board. This time is crucial to let the seasoning permeate the meat and draw some of the moisture toward the surface. After 45 minutes, pat both sides of the steak dry with paper towels again. Don't worry if some of the seasoning comes off, as most of the flavor in already soaked into the meat."", 'Preheat your oven to 400 degrees. Using a deep cast iron skillet, place it on high heat until it is very hot. To the hot pan, add the peanut oil. Once the oil is very hot, use tongs to place your steak in the pan. Be careful not to splatter yourself with hot oil.', 'Cook the steak for 2 minutes on one side, then carefully flip. Add the butter and sprigs of thyme to the pan and spoon the melted butter over the surface of the steak for another 2 minutes.', ""Place the skillet in the hot oven for about 2 minutes. Then check the temperature with a meat thermometer. The center of the steak should read 120 degrees for medium rare. Continue to cook in the oven until 120 degrees is reached. Don't skip this step; as with pork chops, finishing the cooking in a hot oven helps to make the meat more tender and juicy."", 'Turn off the oven and remove the steak from the pan and place it on a clean cutting board to rest for 15 minutes. Resting is extremely important because it allows the juices to move away from the outside and back into the center of the meat. DO NOT cut the meat until it is rested. Once rested, plate the steak and spoon some of the butter and thyme mixture over the steak.', 'While the steak is resting, return the skillet with the pan drippings to the stove and add the onion soup, mushrooms with one can of mushroom juice, and wine to the skillet. Cook on medium high heat, stirring constantly to get the pan juices and brown bits off the bottom of the skillet. Continue cooking at a boil until the sauce reduces down to a thin gravy. This should take 10-15 minutes and be ready when your steak is done resting! Serve mushrooms either on top, or on the side of the steak.', 'TIPS:', 'Choose a bone-in Ribeye or Top Sirloin or Filet, and be sure the label says USDA Choice or Prime cut. A cut labeled Select will not give you a good result. Your steak should have a nice marbling of fat throughout.', 'DO NOT use regular table salt, it will be too salty. Kosher salt or sea salt works great.', ""If you can't find whole button mushrooms in a can or jar, you can use sliced. I have tried using fresh mushrooms, but the flavor is not the same. If you do use fresh mushrooms, you may want to blanch them first to preserve color and texture."", ""If you don't have French Onion soup, you can use a can of beef broth or stock, and a small onion, diced. Simmer the beef broth and onions for 15 minutes before continuing with the normal instructions."", ""Cast iron is perfect for this because of how well it conducts an even heat. If you don't own at least one good cast iron skillet, consider investing in one. It really does make a difference. If you don't have one, you can use a regular skillet, just make sure it's large enough to fit the whole steak and deep enough to avoid splattering oil on you. Also make sure it is oven safe, because finishing the steak in the pan in a hot oven is very important."", 'When you slice your steak, be sure to cut across the grain, and slice through in one motion without sawing at the meat. Sawing makes the meat tough.', 'Enjoy!']","['time-to-make', 'course', 'main-ingredient', 'preparation', 'for-1-or-2', 'main-dish', 'beef', 'vegetables', 'mushrooms', 'meat', 'steak', 'number-of-servings', '4-hours-or-less']",{'dinner'}

211223,Curry Powder Trio (Take Yer Pick!),"Three curry powder mixtures. British manufacturers developed curry powders in an attempt to provide a ready-made spice mixture equivalent to the kari podi (podi means “powder”) that British colonists became accustomed to in southern India. Essential to the fiery cooking of southern India, sambar podi is the combination of spices that evolved into British-style curry powder. Poudre de Colombo came to the French West Indies with Sri Lankans who were taken there to work on the sugar plantations. Japanese curry powder, under the S&B brand, has been produced since 1923, when Minejiro Yamazaki began blending a well-balanced and sweetly aromatic curry powder especially suited to Japanese tastes. For all curry powders, starting with whole spices and lightly toasting them before grinding yields a more fragrant, fresher mixture. *** NOTE *** Columbo is a French version of curry powder, which originated with the Sri Lankan indentured workers in the FWI. it does not carry the heat of many of the other islands. This mixture carries off-beat ingredients such as roasted rice. Roasting gives the rice a nutty flavor and makes it easier to grind. The rice acts as both a flavoring and a natural thickener. Poudre de Columbo makes a great holiday Gift, being one of the lesser-known cuisines of the Caribbean. You also can use it as you would any curry powder.","['ground coriander', 'besan flour', 'ground cumin', 'fresh coarse ground black pepper', 'salt', 'ground fenugreek', 'amchur powder', 'dry mustard', 'red chili powder', 'ground cinnamon', 'turmeric', 'dried curry leaves', 'asafoetida powder', 'ground coriander', 'ground cumin', 'ground turmeric', 'ground ginger', 'dry mustard', 'ground fenugreek', 'ground black pepper', 'ground cinnamon', 'ground cloves', 'ground cardamom', 'chili pepper', 'white rice', 'cumin seed', 'coriander seed', 'black mustard seeds', 'black peppercorns', 'fenugreek seeds', 'whole cloves', 'turmeric']","["""",""3   tablespoons    ground coriander"",""3   tablespoons    besan flour (chickpea)"",""1   tablespoon    ground cumin"",""1 1/2  teaspoons    fresh coarse ground black pepper"",""1   teaspoon    salt"",""1   teaspoon    ground fenugreek"",""1   teaspoon    amchur powder"",""1   teaspoon    dry mustard"",""1   teaspoon   hot red chili powder"",""1/2  teaspoon    ground cinnamon"",""1/2  teaspoon    turmeric"",""8      crumbled dried curry leaves"",""1/4  teaspoon    asafoetida powder"","""",""5   tablespoons    ground coriander"",""2   tablespoons    ground cumin"",""1   tablespoon    ground turmeric"",""2   teaspoons    ground ginger"",""2   teaspoons    dry mustard"",""2   teaspoons    ground fenugreek"",""1 1/2  teaspoons    ground black pepper"",""1   teaspoon    ground cinnamon"",""1/2  teaspoon    ground cloves"",""1/2  teaspoon    ground cardamom"",""1/2  teaspoon   ground chili pepper"","""",""1/4  cup    white rice"",""1/4  cup    cumin seed"",""1/4  cup    coriander seed"",""1   tablespoon    black mustard seeds"",""1   tablespoon    black peppercorns"",""1   tablespoon    fenugreek seeds"",""1   teaspoon    whole cloves"",""2   teaspoons    turmeric""]",1 (233 g),1,"['To make sambar podi -- Combine 3 tablespoons ground coriander; 3 tablespoons besan (chickpea) flour; 1 tablespoon ground cumin; 1 1/2 teaspoons coarsely ground black pepper; 1 teaspoon each salt, ground fenugreek seeds, amchur powder, dry mustard, and hot red chile powder; 1/2 teaspoon each ground cinnamon and turmeric; 8 crumbled dried curry leaves; and 1/4 teaspoon asafetida.
