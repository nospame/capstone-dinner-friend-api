While it didn't harden like a praline, it was just simply too thick.  I've adjusted the quantities of milk and powdered sugar in order to have a filling that is spreadable.  After it cools, you may need to thin it with a little more evaporated milk.  If it's too thick start adding one tablespoon at a time until you get a consistency that can easily be spread on a cake without tearing the cake.  You are looking for a consistency that will slowly drip off of your mixing spoon.  There are other recipes for praline fillings that aren't cooked.  However, I find that the cooking of the mixture adds extra flavor and a richness that will not achieve by just mixing the ingredients together.
